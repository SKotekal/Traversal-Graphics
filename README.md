# Traversal-Graphics
Accepts input image and calculates average pixel color. Fills in with average pixel color and then calculates variance between average pixel color and actual image. If the error is above a certain threshold, the current rectangle is cut into four quadrants, and the process repeats until the error threshold is reached.
